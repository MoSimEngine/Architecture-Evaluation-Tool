### Architecture Evaluation Tool

Architecture Evaluation Tool is a (re)implementation of the [original tool](https://github.com/rju/architecture-evaluation-tool).
This version does not require any eclipse instances.


### Performance

This implementation is not really benchmarked. If you have issues with the performance feel free to get in contact and/or give me a profiler license.
